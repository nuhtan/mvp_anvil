#  MVP Anvil

This is a minimum viable product for my Minecraft 1.18 experimental snapshot mining analysis. The goal of this is to create code that runs faster than the python equivalent.

## Functionality exposed:
- Region::from_file()
- Region::get_chunk()
- Chunk::get_block()
- Block.id

## What needs to still happen:
- Documentation
- Some form of testing to validate that the right blocks are being retrieved
